# All Linux Distro's Reverse Shell (ALDRSl13LL)

This is a simple reverse shell with both the attacker's code and the exploit.

to execute, run the attack code on the attackers machine
chmod +x attack && ./attack
then enter the port to listen to

on the victim's machine run
chmod +x exploit && ./exploit
then enter the attacker's ip address and the port that you want to connect on the attacker's machine
